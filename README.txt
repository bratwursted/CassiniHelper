Cassini Helper

This CMS was created during the development of our Cassini HD app for iPad. We used it to organize and curate content for the app. The main view lays out images in a grid for easy navigation, with controls to view, select, and hide images. It also allows the user to edit metadata for each image and batch controls to fetch images from a remote server. This application was built using the CakePHP framework with an SQLite database. Included here are the model, view, and controller files that I created.
